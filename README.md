# Welcome True Believers
This is a mod for the Marvel Champions LCG by Fantasy Flight Games. I've worked to automate certain aspects of set up to make this easier to set up, and a bit lower memory for the intial load. Just about EVERYTHING in the mod is stored inside a bag so the initial loading time is fairly short.

**THIS IS CURRENTLY IN BETA**

_By that I mean not all of the features are fully baked. Not everything will work cleanly. I also know that this is a part time project and if I wait till it's fully baked I'll never actually release it to ya'll. I've been using this for my weekly game with friends for over 2 months now._

## Features
* Deck Imports from [MarvelCDB](https://marvelcdb.com/)
* Dynamic table size based on number of players
* Quick setup of encounters and heros
* More as I get more time and gumption to add them
